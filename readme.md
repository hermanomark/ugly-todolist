## Ugly todolist

This app was made when I did the course of <a href ="https://watchandcode.com/p/practical-javascript">Practical Javascript </a> by Gordon Zhu, I think the way he teaches the concept and putting it in action in a real practical use is really great, I probably have to go through the course again to really cement what I've learned.
